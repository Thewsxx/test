All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
<br>
<br>

In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.
<br>
<br>

<h2><b>What is HTML?</b></h2>

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
<br>
<br>

HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
<br>
<br>
In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
<ol>
    <li>The opening tag</li>
    <li>The closing tag</li>
    <li>The actual element</li>

</ol>

There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:

<li>To build web applications</li>
<li>To impress friends</li>

</ol>
